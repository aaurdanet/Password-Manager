Password Manager

This Python script is a simple password manager GUI application built using Tkinter, a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. It offers users the ability to generate strong passwords and securely store them alongside associated website URLs and usernames or email addresses.
Overview:

Password Generation: Users can generate strong passwords with the click of a button. The generated passwords consist of a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
Data Storage: Users can input website URLs, usernames or email addresses, and passwords into the application. Upon confirmation, this information is saved securely in a JSON file named data.json.
Graphical Interface: The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction. Users can navigate through input fields, generate passwords, and save data with intuitive button clicks.
Error Handling: The script includes error handling functionalities. It prompts users with error messages if they attempt to save incomplete information or if the data file is not found.

How to Use:

Run the Script: Execute the script using Python.
Input Information: Enter the website URL, username/email, and password into the corresponding input fields.
Generate Password (Optional): Optionally, click on the "Generate Password" button to automatically create a strong password.
Save Data: Click on the "Add" button to securely save the entered information. Confirm the save operation when prompted.
Review Saved Information: The data is stored in data.json, which can be reviewed or edited as needed.

Requirements:

Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Tkinter: Tkinter is typically included with Python installations, so no additional installation steps are required.

Note:

Security Consideration: Please be mindful that the passwords are stored in a JSON file named data.json. Although this provides some level of security, it's recommended to employ additional security measures, such as encryption, if storing sensitive information.
Master Password: Remember to keep track of the master password used for accessing this application, as it does not offer encryption for the stored passwords.

This script provides a basic yet functional solution for managing passwords conveniently within a graphical environment.
